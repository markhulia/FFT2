//This class applies the processes normally used

// to be very fast.  The purpose of an object of
// this class is to illustrate the processes in a
// more easily understood fashion that is often
// the case with an actual FFT algorithm.

	// ===========================================//

	// This method accepts an incoming complex
	// sample value and the position in the series
	// associated with that sample. The method
	// calculates the real and imaginary transform
	// values associated with that complex sample
	// when it is located at the specified
	// position. Then it updates the corresponding
	// real and imaginary values contained in array
	// objects used to accumulate the real and
	// imaginary values for all of the samples.
	// References to the array objects are received
	// as input parameters. Outgoing results are
	// scaled by an incoming parameter in an
	// attempt to cause the output values to fall
	// within a reasonable range in case someone
	// wants to plot them.
